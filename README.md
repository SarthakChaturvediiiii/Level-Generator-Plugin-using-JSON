# Level-Generator-Plugin-using-JSON
I have developed this plugin for generting the level using the Json file. you can add the position rotation and size of the object in the json and the object will instantiated using that information and generate the level for you
You have to add the level generator script in the scene
Then assign the prefabs and if you have more than the available prefab then Edit the script to add more prefabs according to the JSON file
Click on tools Then click on level generator a dialog box will appear
Click on browse Json file and select the Json file which you want to use
Click on load Json file that will show you the number of collectibles and obstacles
Click on generate level it will take values from Jason file and generate the level according to the Json file
The plugin is find for size rotation position of the collectibles and obstacles 
you can edit the size rotation and position of collectibles and obstacles from Json file 
you can edit the dimensions of the ground from Json file 
if you want to add more functionalities just added the Json file and level data script to deserialize 
then edit the level generator script according to your needs
